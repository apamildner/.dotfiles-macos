## Overview
* [Requirements](#requirements)
* [Installation](#installation)
* [Customization](#customize)
* [Content](#content)
## Requirements
To be able to install the dotfiles, you are going to need `git` and `curl`. These are shipped with the **command-line-tools.** To install these run:

```
xcode-select --install
```
## Installation
The dotfiles are configured to be installed under `~/.dotfiles-macos/`by default and should be cloned into `$HOME`.
**See** [location](#Location) to change this.

1. Clone this repository with:
```
git clone https://github.com/jonjohansen/.dotfiles-macos.git ~/.dotfiles-macos
```
2. 
#### Full installation
Execute the installation script for full installation
```
./installation
```
This installs all the applicatins, settings and configurations
#### Partial installation
This only installs configurations and settings (Recommended for only adjusting your settings, dotfiles etc)
```
./config
```

## Customize
Everything can be customized, and it is recommended to get an overlook of what the dotfiles install and adjust them to preferred settings.
### Location 
If you want to install the dotfiles somewhere else some paths are dependent on the DOTFILES variable.

in **`.zshrc`**
```
export DOTFILES="$HOME/.dotfiles-macos/"
```
**Note**:

The reference to `$DOTFILES` in  `installation` will figure itself out. Don't worry about it. ðŸ˜‰
